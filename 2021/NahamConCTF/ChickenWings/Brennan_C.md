# Problem

Given a file called chicken_wings which is UTF-8 encoded text. This means there's either
different languages or it's emojis.

# Solution

`cat chicken_wings` reveals the contents to be written in wingdings. 
The message: `♐●♋♑❀♏📁🖮🖲📂♍♏⌛🖰♐🖮📂🖰📂🖰🖰♍📁🗏🖮🖰♌📂♍📁♋🗏♌♎♍🖲♏❝`

Put this through a wingding-to-ASCII converter to get `flag{e0791ce68f718188c0378b1c0a3bdc9e}`
